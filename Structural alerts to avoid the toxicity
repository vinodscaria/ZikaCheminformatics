 Back ground 
 
 
Virtual screening of bioassays for   discarding the   toxic molecules   shall help to design safe molecular set for the downstream biochemical analysis of the   active molecules available from the bio assays.
It will help to get precise understanding about the reactivity of these structural alerts in the new drug candidates which is critical from the safety point of drug design and development 
The chemical strategies applied to structural alerts in molecules to limit the toxicity are:
• Partial replacement or full replacement of the structural alert;
• Reduction of electronic density;
• Introduction of a structural element of metabolic interest (metabolic switching)

Aim 

To virtually screen  and assign the toxicity ranking to the molecules available in the    Zika related active  molecules in the  bioassays.
